A cheat sheet/study guide for Oxford's <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/elias.koutsoupias/pc2018-19/">Probability & Computing</a> course. Probably the most engaging (and frustrating) course I've taken so far. Disgustingly yet beautifully theoretical. Hopefully I'll get to some practical examples soon...

#### Motivations
There are a lot of difficult problems in computer science. Many of them we can only solve probabilistically. Others we can solve faster using a probabilistic algorithm, with either no hit to accuracy or a controlled hit bound by some error $\epsilon$ and probability of being within that bound $\delta$.

#### Life is a Probability Stream

I had this idea independently (in the face of the outcome of undergraduate college admissions, 'meritocracy', what I'd been working towards for pretty much my whole life) and it's cool to see Elon reach this conclusion too. Don't pretend like your actions are deterministic kids -- the best you can do is change your probability stream to your liking and roll with the punches.

Brief paraphrase: Technology DEGRADES without high effort from key people. It actually degrades.
