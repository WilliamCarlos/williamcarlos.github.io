The great flip phone experiment. Cell phone technology peaked in the early 2000s. Come with me on this adventure as I document this roller coaster of a ride.

#### Day 0 - Day 6
**Number of 'this guy is crazy looks' counter**: 0
Didn't really try but also failed miserably. Used my phone as usual (a lot).

#### March 7th, 2019
9:15am: Finally turned off my phone. Was checking my phone at Society Cafe and just felt.. bored? Checked instagram like twice and nothing changed since the morning. So we're finally phone-free. The walk from Society back to Anne's felt kind of long. But in a nice way; I felt much more mindful. It could almost be described as meditative.

10:59am: Working on implementing this weight uncertainty paper. Feeling urges to go check social media. It's not that I'm curious as to if I've missed anything (I almost certainly haven't) but more so that I want a break from thinking... Maybe I'll just stare off into the distance. I need a good habit to replace this with. Meditate/relax?
