The great flip phone experiment. Cell phone technology peaked in the early 2000s. Come with me on this adventure as I document this roller coaster of a ride.

Finally turned off my phone. Was checking my phone at Society Cafe and just felt.. bored? Checked instagram like twice and nothing changed since the morning. So we're finally phone-free. The walk from Society back to Anne's felt kind of long. But in a nice way; I felt much more mindful. It could almost be described as meditative.
